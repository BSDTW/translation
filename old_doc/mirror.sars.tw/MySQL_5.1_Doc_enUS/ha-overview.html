    When using MySQL you may need to ensure the availability or
    scalability of your MySQL installation. Availability refers to the
    ability to cope with, and if necessary recover from, failures on the
    host, including failures of MySQL, the operating system, or the
    hardware. Scalability refers to the ability to spread the load of
    your application queries across multiple MySQL servers. As your
    application and usage increases, you may need to spread the queries
    for the application across multiple servers to improve response
    times.
  </p><p>
    There are a number of solutions available for solving issues of
    availability and scalability. The two primary solutions supported by
    MySQL are MySQL Replication and MySQL Cluster. Further options are
    available using third-party solutions such as DRBD (Distributed
    Replicated Block Device) and Heartbeat, and more complex scenarios
    can be solved through a combination of these technologies. These
    tools work in different ways:
  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
        <span class="emphasis"><em>MySQL Replication</em></span> enables statements and
        data from one MySQL server instance to be replicated to another
        MySQL server instance. Without using more complex setups, data
        can only be replicated from a single master server to any number
        of slaves. The replication is asynchronous, so the
        synchronization does not take place in real time, and there is
        no guarantee that data from the master will have been replicated
        to the slaves.
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>

                MySQL Replication is available on all platforms
                supported by MySQL, and since it isn't operating
                system-specific it can operate across different
                platforms.
              </p></li><li><p>
                Replication is asynchronous and can be stopped and
                restarted at any time, making it suitable for
                replicating over slower links, partial links and even
                across geographical boundaries.
              </p></li><li><p>
                Data can be replicated from one master to any number of
                slaves, making replication suitable in environments with
                heavy reads, but light writes (for example, many web
                applications), by spreading the load across multiple
                slaves.
              </p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>
            <span class="bold"><strong>Disadvantages</strong></span>
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="square"><li><p>
                Data can only be written to the master. In advanced
                configurations, though, you can set up a multiple-master
                configuration where the data is replicated around a ring
                configuration.
              </p></li><li><p>
                There is no guarantee that data on master and slaves
                will be consistent at a given point in time. Because
                replication is asynchronous there may be a small delay
                between data being written to the master and it being
                available on the slaves. This can cause problems in
                applications where a write to the master must be
                available for a read on the slaves (for example a web
                application).

                Scale-out solutions that require a large number of reads
                but fewer writes (for example, web serving).

                Logging/data analysis of live data. By replicating live
                data to a slave you can perform queries on the slave
                without affecting the operation of the master.
              </p></li><li><p>
                Online backup (availability), where you need an active
                copy of the data available. You need to combine this
                with other tools, such as custom scripts or Heartbeat.
                However, because of the asynchronous architecture, the
                data may be incomplete.
              </p></li><li><p>
                Offline backup. You can use replication to keep a copy
                of the data. By replicating the data to a slave, you
                take the slave down and get a reliable snapshot of the
                data (without MySQL running), then restart MySQL and
                replication to catch up. The master (and any other
                slaves) can be kept running during this period.

        <span class="emphasis"><em>DRBD (Distributed Replicated Block Device)</em></span>
        is a solution from Linbit supported only on Linux. DRBD creates
        a virtual block device (which is associated with an underlying
        physical block device) that can be replicated from the primary
        server to a secondary server. You create a filesystem on the
        virtual block device, and this information is then replicated,
        at the block level, to the secondary server.
      </p><p>
        Because the block device, not the data you are storing on it, is
        being replicated the validity of the information is more
        reliable than with data-only replication solutions. DRBD can
        also ensure data integrity by only returning from a write
        operation on the primary server when the data has been written
        to the underlying physical block device on both the primary and
        secondary servers.

    The Distributed Replicated Block Device (DRBD) is a Linux Kernel
    module that constitutes a distributed storage system. You can use
    DRBD to share block devices between Linux servers and, in turn,
    share filesystems and data.
  </p><p>
    DRBD implements a block device which can be used for storage and
    which is replicated from a primary server to one or more secondary
    servers. The distributed block device is handled by the DRBD
    service. Writes to the DRBD block device are distributed among the
    servers. Each DRBD service writes the information from the DRBD
    block device to a local physical block device (hard disk).
  </p><p>
    On the primary, for example, the data writes are written both to the
    underlying physical block device and distributed to the secondary
    DRBD services. On the secondary, the writes received through DRBD
    and written to the local physical block device. On both the primary
    and the secondary, reads from the DRBD block device are handled by
    the underlying physical block device. The information is shared
    between the primary DRBD server and the secondary DRBD server
    synchronously and at a block level, and this means that DRBD can be
    used in high-availability solutions where you need failover support.
  </p><div class="figure"><a name="ha-drbd-overview"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 14.1. DRBD Architecture</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/drbd-main.png" alt="DRBD Architecture"></div></div><p>
    When used with MySQL, DRBD can be used to ensure availability in the
    event of a failure. MySQL is configured to store information on the
    DRBD block device, with one server acting as the primary and a
    second machine available to operate as an immediate replacement in
    the event of a failure.
  </p><p>
    For automatic failover support you can combine DRBD with the Linux
    Heartbeat project, which will manage the interfaces on the two
    servers and automatically configure the secondary (passive) server
    to replace the primary (active) server in the event of a failure.
    You can also combine DRBD with MySQL Replication to provide both
    failover and scalability within your MySQL environment.
  </p><p>

    Heartbeat support, see <a href="ha-overview.html#ha-drbd-install" title="14.1.1. Configuring the DRBD Environment">Section 14.1.1, “Configuring the DRBD Environment”</a>.

      To set up DRBD, MySQL and Heartbeat you need to follow a number of
      steps that affect the operating system, DRBD and your MySQL
      installation.
    </p><p>
      Before starting the installation process, you should be aware of
      the following information, terms and requirements on using DRBD:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
          DRBD is a solution for enabling high-availability, and
          therefore you need to ensure that the two machines within your
          DRBD setup are as identically configured as possible so that
          the secondary machine can act as a direct replacement for the
          primary machine in the event of system failure.
        </p></li><li><p>
          DRBD works through two (or more) servers, each called a
          <em class="firstterm">node</em>
        </p></li><li><p>
          The node that contains the primary data, has read/write access
          to the data, and in an HA environment is the currently active
          node is called the <em class="firstterm">primary</em>.
        </p></li><li><p>
          The server to which the data is replicated is referred as
          <em class="firstterm">secondary</em>.
        </p></li><li><p>
          A collection of nodes that are sharing information are
          referred to as a <em class="firstterm">DRBD cluster</em>.
        </p></li><li><p>
          For DRBD to operate you must have a block device on which the
          information can be stored on <span class="emphasis"><em>each</em></span> DRBD
          node. The <em class="firstterm">lower level</em> block device can
          be a physical disk partition, a partition from a volume group
          or RAID device or any other block device.
        </p><p>
          Typically you use a spare partition on which the physical data
          will be stored . On the primary node, this disk will hold the
          raw data that you want replicated. On the secondary nodes, the
          disk will hold the data replicated to the secondary server by
          the DRBD service. Ideally, the size of the partition on the
          two DRBD servers should be identical, but this is not
          necessary as long as there is enough space to hold the data
          that you want distributed between the two servers.
        </p></li><li><p>
          For the distribution of data to work, DRBD is used to create a
          logical block device that uses the lower level block device
          for the actual storage of information. To store information on
          the distributed device, a filesystem is created on the DRBD
          logical block device.
        </p></li><li><p>
          When used with MySQL, once the filesystem has been created,
          you move the MySQL data directory (including InnoDB data files
          and binary logs) to the new filesystem.
        </p></li><li><p>
          When you set up the secondary DRBD server, you set up the
          physical block device and the DRBD logical block device that
          will store the data. The block device data is then copied from
          the primary to the secondary server.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      The overview for the installation and configuration sequence is as
      follows:
    </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
          First you need to set up your operating system and
          environment. This includes setting the correct hostname,
          updating the system and preparing the available packages and
          software required by DRBD, and configuring a physical block
          device to be used with the DRBD block device. See
          <a href="ha-overview.html#ha-drbd-install-os" title="14.1.1.1. Setting Up the OS for DRBD">Section 14.1.1.1, “Setting Up the OS for DRBD”</a>.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Installing DRBD requires installing or compiling the DRBD
          source code and then configuring the DRBD service to set up
          the block devices that will be shared. See
          <a href="ha-overview.html#ha-drbd-install-drbd" title="14.1.1.2. Installing and Configuring DRBD">Section 14.1.1.2, “Installing and Configuring DRBD”</a>.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Once DRBD has been configured, you must alter the
          configuration and storage location of the MySQL data. See
          <a href="ha-overview.html#ha-drbd-install-mysql" title="14.1.2. Configuring MySQL for DRBD">Section 14.1.2, “Configuring MySQL for DRBD”</a>.
        </p></li></ol></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="ha-drbd-install-os"></a>14.1.1.1. Setting Up the OS for DRBD</h4></div></div></div><p>
        To set your Linux environment for using DRBD there are a number
        of system configuration steps that you must follow.
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
            Make sure that the primary and secondary DRBD servers have
            the correct hostname, and that the hostnames are unique. You
            can verify this by using the <span><strong class="command">uname</strong></span>
            command:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">$ uname -n
drbd-one
</pre><p>
            If the hostname is not set correctly then edit the
            appropriate file (usually
            <code class="filename">/etc/sysconfig/network</code>,
            <code class="filename">/etc/hostname</code>, or
            <code class="filename">/etc/conf.d/hostname</code>) and set the name
            correctly.
          </p></li><li><p>
            Each DRBD node must have a unique IP address. Make sure that
            the IP address information is set correctly within the
            network configuration and that the hostname and IP address
            has been set correctly within the
            <code class="filename">/etc/hosts</code> file.
          </p></li><li><p>
            Although you can rely on the DNS or NIS system for host
            resolving, in the event of a major network failure these
            services may not be available. If possible, add the IP
            address and hostname of each DRBD node into the /etc/hosts
            file for each machine. This will ensure that the node
            information can always be determined even if the DNS/NIS
            servers are unavailable.
          </p></li><li><p>
            As a general rule, the faster your network connection the
            better. Because the block device data is exchanged over the
            network, everything that will be written to the local disk
            on the DRBD primary will also be written to the network for
            distribution to the DRBD secondary.
          </p></li><li><p>
            You must have a spare disk or disk partition that you can
            use as the physical storage location for the DRBD data that
            will be replicated. You do not have to have a complete disk
            available, a partition on an existing disk is acceptable.
          </p><p>
            If the disk is unpartitioned, partition the disk using
            <span><strong class="command">fdisk</strong></span>, <span><strong class="command">cfdisk</strong></span> or other
            partitioning solution.. Do not create a filesystem on the
            new partition.
          </p><p>
            Remember that you must have a physical disk available for
            the storage of the replicated information on each DRBD node.
            Ideally the partitions that will be used on each node should
            be of an identical size, although this is not strictly
            necessary. Do, however, ensure that the physical partition
            on the DRBD secondary is at least as big as the partitions
            on the DRBD primary node.
          </p></li><li><p>
            If possible, upgrade your system to the latest available
            Linux kernel for your distribution. Once the kernel has been
            installed, you must reboot to make the kernel active. To use
            DRBD you will also need to install the relevant kernel
            development and header files that are required for building
            kernel modules. Platform specification information for this
            is available later in this section.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        Before you compile or install DRBD, you must make sure the
        following tools and files are in place:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
            Kernel header files
          </p></li><li><p>
            Kernel source files
          </p></li><li><p>
            GCC Compiler
          </p></li><li><p>
            <code class="literal">glib 2</code>

        Here are some operating system specific tips for setting up your
        installation:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>

            files:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">root-shell&gt; up2date kernel-smp-devel kernel-smp</pre><p>
            Reboot. If you are going to build DRBD from source, then

          </p><pre class="programlisting">root-shell&gt; apt-get install linux-headers linux-image-server</pre><p>
            If you are going to use the pre-built Debian packages for
            DRBD then you should not need any additional packages.
          </p><p>
            If you want to build DRBD from source, you will need to use
            the following command to install the required components:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">root-shell&gt; apt-get install devscripts flex bison build-essential \
dpkg-dev kernel-package debconf-utils dpatch debhelper \

            <span class="bold"><strong>Tips for Gentoo</strong></span>:
          </p><p>
            Gentoo is a source based Linux distribution and therefore
            many of the source files and components that you will need
            are either already installed or will be installed
            automatically by <span><strong class="command">emerge</strong></span>.
          </p><p>
            To install DRBD 0.8.x, you must unmask the
            <code class="literal">sys-cluster/drbd</code> build by adding the
            following line to
            <code class="filename">/etc/portage/package.keywords</code>:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">sys-cluster/drbd ~x86
sys-cluster/drbd-kernel ~x86</pre><p>
            If your kernel does not already have the userspace to
            kernelspace linker enabled, then you will need to rebuild
            the kernel with this option. The best way to do this is to
            use <span><strong class="command">genkernel</strong></span> with the
            <code class="option">--menuconfig</code> option to select the option
            and then rebuild the kernel. For example, at the command
            line as <code class="literal">root</code>:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">root-shell&gt; genkernel --menuconfig all</pre><p>
            Then through the menu options, select <span class="guimenu">Device
            Drivers</span>, <span class="guimenu">Connector - unified userspace
            &lt;-&gt; kernelspace linker</span> and finally press 'y'
            or 'space' to select the <span class="guimenu">Connector - unified
            userspace &lt;-&gt; kernelspace linker</span> option.
            Then exit the menu configuration. The kernel will be rebuilt
            and installed. If this is a new kernel, make sure you update
            your bootloader accordingly. Now reboot to enable the new
            kernel.
          </p><p>
            You can now <span><strong class="command">emerge</strong></span> DRBD 0.8.x into your
            Gentoo installation:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">root-shell&gt; emerge drbd</pre><p>
            Once <code class="literal">drbd</code> has been downloaded and
            installed, you need to decompress and copy the default
            configuration file from
            <code class="filename">/usr/share/doc/drbd-8.0.7/drbd.conf.bz2</code>
            into <code class="filename">/etc/drbd.conf</code>.
          </p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="ha-drbd-install-drbd"></a>14.1.1.2. Installing and Configuring DRBD</h4></div></div></div><p>
        To install DRBD you can choose either the pre-built binary
        installation packages or you can use the source packages and
        build from source. If you want to build from source you must
        have installed the source and development packages.
      </p><p>
        If you are installing using a binary distribution then you must
        ensure that the kernel version number of the binary package
        matches your currently active kernel. You can use
        <span><strong class="command">uname</strong></span> to find out this information:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">$ uname -r
2.6.20-gentoo-r6</pre><p>
        To build from the sources, download the source
        <code class="literal">tar.gz</code> package, extract the contents and then
        follow the instructions within the <code class="filename">INSTALL</code>
        file.
      </p><p>
        Once DRBD has been built and installed, you need to edit the
        <code class="filename">/etc/drbd.conf</code> file and then run a number
        of commands to build the block device and set up the
        replication.
      </p><p>
        Although the steps below are split into those for the primary
        node and the secondary node, it should be noted that the
        configuration files for all nodes should be identical, and many
        of the same steps have to be repeated on each node to enable the
        DRBD block device.
      </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="ha-drbd-install-drbd-primary"></a>14.1.1.3. Setting Up a DRBD Primary Node</h4></div></div></div><p>
        To set up a DRBD primary node you need to configure the DRBD
        service, create the first DRBD block device and then create a
        filesystem on the device so that you can store files and data.
      </p><p>
        The DRBD configuration file
        (<code class="filename">/etc/drbd.conf</code>) defined a number of
        parameters for your DRBD configuration, including the frequency
        of updates and block sizes, security information and the
        definition of the DRBD devices that you want to create.
      </p><p>
        The key elements to configure are the <code class="literal">on</code>
        sections which specify the configuration of each node.
      </p><p>
        To follow the configuration, the sequence below shows only the
        changes from the default <code class="filename">drbd.conf</code> file.
        Configurations within the file can be both global or tied to
        specific resource.
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
            Set the synchronization rate between the two nodes. This is
            the rate at which devices are synchronized in the background
            after a disk failure, device replacement or during the
            initial setup. You should keep this in check compared to the
            speed of your network connection. Gigabit Ethernet can
            support up to 125 MB/second, 100Mbps Ethernet slightly less
            than a tenth of that (12MBps). If you are using a shared
            network connection, rather than a dedicated, then you should
            gauge accordingly.
          </p><p>
            For more detailed information on synchronization, the
            effects of the synchronization rate and the effects on
            network performance, see
            <a href="ha-overview.html#ha-drbd-performance-syncrate" title="14.1.3.2. Optimizing the Synchronization Rate">Section 14.1.3.2, “Optimizing the Synchronization Rate”</a>.
          </p><p>
            To set the synchronization rate, edit the
            <code class="literal">rate</code> setting within the
            <code class="literal">syncer</code> block:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">syncer {
    rate 10M;
}</pre></li><li><p>
            Set up some basic authentication. DRBD supports a simple
            password hash exchange mechanism. This helps to ensure that
            only those hosts with the same shared secret are able to
            join the DRBD node group.
          </p><pre class="programlisting">cram-hmac-alg “sha1”;
shared-secret "<em class="replaceable"><code>shared-string</code></em>";</pre></li><li><p>
            Now you must configure the host information. Remember that
            you must have the node information for the primary and
            secondary nodes in the <code class="filename">drbd.conf</code> file
            on each host. You need to configure the following
            information for each node:
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
                <code class="literal">device</code> — the path of the
                logical block device that will be created by DRBD.
              </p></li><li><p>
                <code class="literal">disk</code> — the block device that
                will be used to store the data.
              </p></li><li><p>
                <code class="literal">address</code> — the IP address and
                port number of the host that will hold this DRBD device.
              </p></li><li><p>
                <code class="literal">meta-disk</code> — the location where
                the metadata about the DRBD device will be stored. You
                can set this to <code class="literal">internal</code> and DRBD
                will use the physical block device to store the
                information, by recording the metadata within the last
                sections of the disk. The exact size will depend on the
                size of the logical block device you have created, but
                it may involve up to 128MB.
              </p></li></ul></div><p>
            A sample configuration for our primary server might look
            like this:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">on drbd-one {
device /dev/drbd0;
disk /dev/hdd1;
address 192.168.0.240:8888;
meta-disk internal;
}</pre><p>
            The <code class="literal">on</code> configuration block should be
            repeated for the secondary node (and any further) nodes:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">on drbd-two {
device /dev/drbd0;
disk /dev/hdd1;
address 192.168.0.241:8888;
meta-disk internal;
}</pre><p>
            The IP address of each <code class="literal">on</code> block must
            match the IP address of the corresponding host. Do not set
            this value to the IP address of the corresponding primary or
            secondary in each case.
          </p></li><li><p>
            Before starting the primary node, you should create the
            metadata for the devices:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">root-shell&gt; drbdadm create-md all</pre></li><li><p>
            You are now ready to start DRBD:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">root-shell&gt; /etc/init.d/drbd start</pre><p>
            DRBD should now start and initialize, creating the DRBD
            devices that you have configured.
          </p></li><li><p>
            DRBD creates a standard block device - to make it usable,
            you must create a filesystem on the block device just as you
            would with any standard disk partition. Before you can
            create the filesystem, you must mark the new device as the
            primary device (i.e. where the data will be written and
            stored), and initialize the device. Because this is a
            destructive operation, you must specify the command line
            option to overwrite the raw data:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">root-shell&gt; drbdadm -- --overwrite-data-of-peer primary all</pre><p>
            If you are using a version of DRBD 0.7.x or earlier, then
            you need to use a different command-line option:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">root-shell&gt; drbdadm -- --do-what-I-say primary all</pre><p>
            Now create a filesystem using your chosen filesystem type:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">root-shell&gt; mkfs.ext3 /dev/drbd0</pre></li><li><p>
            You can now mount the filesystem and if necessary copy files
            to the mount point:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">root-shell&gt; mkdir /mnt/drbd
root-shell&gt; mount /dev/drbd0 /mnt/drbd
root-shell&gt; echo "DRBD Device" &gt;/mnt/drbd/samplefile</pre></li></ol></div><p>
        Your primary node is now ready to use. You should now configure
        your secondary node or nodes.
      </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="ha-drbd-install-drbd-secondary"></a>14.1.1.4. Setting Up a DRBD Secondary Node</h4></div></div></div><p>
        The configuration process for setting up a secondary node is the
        same as for the primary node, except that you do not have to
        create the filesystem on the secondary node device, as this
        information will automatically be transferred from the primary
        node.
      </p><p>
        To set up a secondary node:
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
            Copy the <code class="filename">/etc/drbd.conf</code> file from your
            primary node to your secondary node. It should already
            contain all the information and configuration that you need,
            since you had to specify the secondary node IP address and
            other information for the primary node configuration.
          </p></li><li><p>
            Create the DRBD metadata on the underlying disk device:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">root-shell&gt; drbdadm create-md all</pre></li><li><p>
            Start DRBD:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">root-shell&gt; /etc/init.d/drbd start</pre></li></ol></div><p>
        Once DRBD has started, it will start the copy the data from the
        primary node to the secondary node. Even with an empty
        filesystem this will take some time, since DRBD is copying the
        block information from a block device, not simply copying the
        filesystem data.
      </p><p>
        You can monitor the progress of the copy between the primary and
        secondary nodes by viewing the output of
        <code class="filename">/proc/drbd</code>:

        The first line provides the version/revision and build
        information.
      </p><p>
        The second line starts the detailed status information for an
        individual resource. The individual field headings are as
        follows:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
            cs — connection state
          </p></li><li><p>
            st — node state (local/remote)
          </p></li><li><p>
            ld — local data consistency
          </p></li><li><p>

            dr — disk read
          </p></li><li><p>
            pe — pending (waiting for ack)

            ua — unack'd (still need to send ack)
          </p></li><li><p>
            al — access log write count
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        In the previous example, the information shown indicates that
        the nodes are connected, the local node is the primary (because
        it is listed first), and the local and remote data is up to date
        with each other. The remainder of the information is statistical
        data about the device, and the data exchanged that kept the
        information up to date.
      </p><p>
        For administration, the main command is
        <span><strong class="command">drbdadm</strong></span>. There are a number of commands
        supported by this tool the control the connectivity and status
        of the DRBD devices.
      </p><p>
        The most common commands are those to set the primary/secondary
        status of the local device. You can manually set this
        information for a number of reasons, including when you want to
        check the physical status of the secondary device (since you
        cannot mount a DRBD device in primary mode), or when you are
        temporarily moving the responsibility of keeping the data in
        check to a different machine (for example, during an upgrade or
        physical move of the normal primary node). You can set state of
        all local device to be the primary using this command:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">root-shell&gt; drbdadm primary all</pre><p>
        Or switch the local device to be the secondary using:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">root-shell&gt; drbdadm secondary all</pre><p>
        To change only a single DRBD resource, specify the resource name
        instead of <code class="literal">all</code>.
      </p><p>
        You can temporarily disconnect the DRBD nodes:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">root-shell&gt; drbdadm disconnect all</pre><p>
        Reconnect them using <code class="literal">connect</code>:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">root-shell&gt; drbdadm connect all</pre><p>
        For other commands and help with <span><strong class="command">drbdadm</strong></span> see
        the DRBD documentation.

        Additional options you may want to configure:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
            <code class="literal">protocol</code> — specifies the level of
            consistency to be used when information is written to the
            block device. The option is similar in principle to the
            <a href="storage-engines.html#option_mysqld_innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit"><code class="literal">innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit</code></a>
            option within MySQL. Three levels are supported:
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>
                <code class="literal">A</code> — data is considered written
                when the information reaches the TCP send buffer and the
                local physical disk. There is no guarantee that the data
                has been written to the remote server or the remote
                physical disk.
              </p></li><li><p>
                <code class="literal">B</code> — data is considered written
                when the data has reached the local disk and the remote
                node's network buffer. The data has reached the remote
                server, but there is no guarantee it has reached the
                remote server's physical disk.
              </p></li><li><p>
                <code class="literal">C</code> — data is considered written
                when the data has reached the local disk and the remote
                node's physical disk.
              </p></li></ul></div><p>
            The preferred and recommended protocol is C, as it is the
            only protocol which ensures the consistency of the local and
            remote physical storage.
          </p></li><li><p>
            <code class="literal">size</code> — if you do not want to use
            the entire partition space with your DRBD block device then
            you can specify the size of the DRBD device to be created.
            The size specification can include a quantifier. For
            example, to set the maximum size of the DRBD partition to
            1GB you would use:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">size 1G;</pre></li></ul></div><p>
        With the configuration file suitably configured and ready to
        use, you now need to populate the lower-level device with the
        metadata information, and then start the DRBD service.
      </p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ha-drbd-install-mysql"></a>14.1.2. Configuring MySQL for DRBD</h3></div></div></div><p>
      Once you have configured DRBD and have an active DRBD device and
      filesystem, you can configure MySQL to use the chosen device to
      store the MySQL data.
    </p><p>
      When performing a new installation of MySQL, you can either select
      to install MySQL entirely onto the DRBD device, or just configure
      the data directory to be located on the new filesystem.
    </p><p>
      In either case, the files and installation must take place on the
      primary node, because that is the only DRBD node on which you can
      mount the DRBD device filesystem as read/write.
    </p><p>
      You should store the following files and information on your DRBD
      device:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
          MySQL data files, including the binary log, and InnoDB data
          files.
        </p></li><li><p>
          MySQL configuration file (<code class="filename">my.cnf</code>).
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      To set up MySQL to use your new DRBD device and filesystem:
    </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
          If you are migrating an existing MySQL installation, stop
          MySQL:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">$ mysqladmin shutdown</pre></li><li><p>
          Copy the <code class="filename">my.cnf</code> onto the DRBD device. If
          you are not already using a configuration file, copy one of
          the sample configuration files from the MySQL distribution.
        </p><pre class="programlisting">root-shell&gt; mkdir /mnt/drbd/mysql
root-shell&gt; cp /etc/my.cnf /mnt/drbd/mysql</pre></li><li><p>
          Copy your MySQL data directory to the DRBD device and mounted
          filesystem.
        </p><pre class="programlisting">root-shell&gt; cp -R /var/lib/mysql /drbd/mysql/data</pre></li><li><p>
          Edit the configuration file to reflect the change of directory
          by setting the value of the <code class="literal">datadir</code> option.
          If you have not already enabled the binary log, also set the
          value of the <code class="literal">log-bin</code> option.
        </p><pre class="programlisting">datadir = /drbd/mysql/data
  log-bin = mysql-bin</pre></li><li><p>
          Create a symbolic link from <code class="filename">/etc/my.cnf</code>
          to the new configuration file on the DRBD device filesystem.
        </p><pre class="programlisting">root-shell&gt; ln -s /drbd/mysql/my.cnf /etc/my.cnf</pre></li><li><p>
          Now start MySQL and check that the data that you copied to the
          DRBD device filesystem is present.
        </p><pre class="programlisting">root-shell&gt; /etc/init.d/mysql start</pre></li></ol></div><p>
      Your MySQL data should now be located on the filesystem running on
      your DRBD device. The data will be physically stored on the
      underlying device that you configured for the DRBD device.
      Meanwhile, the content of your MySQL databases will be copied to
      the secondary DRBD node.
    </p><p>
      Note that you cannot access the information on your secondary
      node, as a DRBD device working in secondary mode is not available
      for use.
    </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ha-drbd-performance"></a>14.1.3. Optimizing Performance and Reliability</h3></div></div></div><div class="toc"><dl><dt><span class="section"><a href="ha-overview.html#ha-drbd-performance-bonded">14.1.3.1. Using Bonded Ethernet Network Interfaces</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="ha-overview.html#ha-drbd-performance-syncrate">14.1.3.2. Optimizing the Synchronization Rate</a></span></dt></dl></div><p>
      Because of the nature of the DRBD system, the critical
      requirements are for a very fast exchange of the information
      between the two hosts. To ensure that your DRBD setup is available
      to switch over in the event of a failure as quickly as possible,
      you must transfer the information between the two hosts using the
      fastest method available.
    </p><p>
      Typically, a dedicated network circuit should be used for
      exchanging DRBD data between the two hosts. You should then use a
      separate, additional, network interface for your standard network
      connection. For an example of this layout, see
      <a href="ha-overview.html#ha-drbd-performance-sepinterface" title="Figure 14.2. DRBD Architecture">Figure 14.2, “DRBD Architecture”</a>.
    </p><div class="figure"><a name="ha-drbd-performance-sepinterface"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 14.2. DRBD Architecture</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/drbd-sepinterface.png" alt="DRBD Architecture"></div></div><p>
      The dedicated DRBD network interfaces should be configured to use
      a non-routed TCP/IP network configuration. For example, you might
      want to set the primary to use 192.168.0.1 and the secondary
      192.168.0.2. These networks and IP addresses should not be part of
      normal network subnet.
    </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
        The preferred setup, whenever possible, is to use a direct cable
        connection (using a crossover cable with Ethernet, for example)
        between the two machines. This eliminates the risk of loss of
        connectivity due to switch failures.
      </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="ha-drbd-performance-bonded"></a>14.1.3.1. Using Bonded Ethernet Network Interfaces</h4></div></div></div><p>
        For a set-up where there is a high-throughput of information
        being written, you may want to use bonded network interfaces.
        This is where you combine the connectivity of more than one
        network port, increasing the throughput linearly according to
        the number of bonded connections.
      </p><p>
        Bonding also provides an additional benefit in that with
        multiple network interfaces effectively supporting the same
        communications channel, a fault within a single network
        interface in a bonded group does not stop communication. For
        example, imagine you have a bonded setup with four network
        interfaces providing a single interface channel between two DRBD
        servers. If one network interface fails, communication can
        continue on the other three without interruption, although it
        will be at a lower speed
      </p><p>
        To enable bonded connections you must enable bonding within the
        kernel. You then need to configure the module to specify the
        bonded devices and then configure each new bonded device just as
        you would a standard network device:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
            To configure the bonded devices, you need to edit the
            <code class="filename">/etc/modprobe.conf</code> file (RedHat) or add
            a file to the <code class="filename">/etc/modprobe.d</code>
            directory.. In each case you will define the parameters for
            the kernel module. First, you need to specify each bonding
            device:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">alias bond0 bonding</pre><p>
            You can then configure additional parameters for the kernel
            module. Typical parameters are the <code class="literal">mode</code>
            option and the <code class="literal">miimon</code> option.
          </p><p>
            The <code class="literal">mode</code> option specifies how the network
            interfaces are used. The default setting is 0, which means
            that each network interface is used in a round-robin fashion
            (this supports aggregation and fault tolerance). Using
            setting 1 sets the bonding mode to active-backup. This means
            that only one network interface is used as a time, but that
            the link will automatically failover to a new interface if
            the primary interface fails. This settings only supports
            fault-tolerance.
          </p><p>
            The <code class="literal">miimon</code> option enables the MII link
            monitoring. A positive value greater than zero indicates the
            monitoring frequency in milliseconds for checking each slave
            network interface that is configured as part of the bonded
            interface. A typical value is 100.
          </p><p>
            You set th options within the module parameter file, and you
            must set the options for each bonded device individually:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">options bond0 miimon=100 mode=1</pre></li><li><p>
            Reboot your server to enable the bonded devices.
          </p></li><li><p>
            Configure the network device parameters. There are two parts
            to this, you need to setup the bonded device configuration,
            and then configure the original network interfaces as
            'slaves' of the new bonded interface.
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>
                For RedHat Linux:

                Edit the configuration file for the bonded device. For
                device <code class="literal">bond0</code> this would be
                <code class="filename">/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond0</code>:

                Then for each network interface that you want to be part
                of the bonded device, configure the interface as a slave
                to the 'master' bond. For example, the configuration of

                <code class="filename">/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0</code>

                Then make sure that you add the new network interface to

        The <code class="literal">syncer rate</code> configuration parameter
        should be configured with care as the synchronization rate can
        have a significant effect on the performance of the DRBD setup
        in the event of a node or disk failure where the information is
        being synchronized from the Primary to the Secondary node.
      </p><p>
        In DRBD, there are two distinct ways of data being transferred
        between peer nodes:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Replication</em></span> refers to the transfer of
            modified blocks being transferred from the primary to the
            secondary node. This happens automatically when the block is
            modified on the primary node, and the replication process
            uses whatever bandwidth is available over the replication
            link. The replication process cannot be throttled, because
            you want to transfer of the block information to happen as
            quickly as possible during normal operation.
          </p></li><li><p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Synchronization</em></span> refers to the process
            of bringing peers back in sync after some sort of outage,
            due to manual intervention, node failure, disk swap, or the
            initial setup. Synchronization is limited to the
            <code class="literal">syncer rate</code> configured for the DRBD
            device.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        Both replication and synchronization can take place at the same
        time. For example, the block devices can be being synchronized
        while they are actively being used by the primary node. Any I/O
        that updates on the primary node will automatically trigger
        replication of the modified block. In the event of a failure
        within an HA environment, it is highly likely that
        synchronization and replication will take place at the same
        time.
      </p><p>
        Unfortunately, if the synchronization rate is set too high, then
        the synchronization process will use up all the available
        network bandwidth between the primary and secondary nodes. In
        turn, the bandwidth available for replication of changed blocks
        is zero, which means replication will stall and I/O will block,
        and ultimately the application will fail or degrade.
      </p><p>
        To avoid enabling the <code class="literal">syncer rate</code> to consume
        the available network bandwidth and prevent the replication of
        changed blocks you should set the <code class="literal">syncer rate</code>
        to less than the maximum network bandwidth.
      </p><p>
        Depending on the application, you may wish to limit the
        synchronization rate. For example, on a busy server you may wish
        to configure a significantly slower synchronization rate to
        ensure the replication rate is not affected.

Dealing with System Level Errors</a></span></dt></dl></div><p>
    The Heartbeat program provides a basis for verifying the
    availability of resources on one or more systems within a cluster.
    In this context a resource includes MySQL, the filesystems on which
    the MySQL data is being stored and, if you are using DRBD, the DRBD
    device being used for the filesystem. Heartbeat also manages a
    virtual IP address, and the virtual IP address should be used for
    all communication to the MySQL instance.
  </p><p>
    A cluster within the context of Heartbeat is defined as two
    computers notionally providing the same service. By definition, each
    computer in the cluster is physically capable of providing the same
    services as all the others in the cluster. However, because the
    cluster is designed for high-availability, only one of the servers
    is actively providing the service at any one time. Each additional
    server within the cluster is a 'hot-spare' that can be brought into
    service in the event of a failure of the master, it's next
    connectivity or the connectivity of the network in general.
  </p><p>
    The basics of Heartbeat are very simple. Within the Heartbeat
    cluster (see <a href="ha-overview.html#ha-heartbeat-overview" title="Figure 14.3. DRBD Architecture">Figure 14.3, “DRBD Architecture”</a>, each machine
    sends a 'heartbeat' signal to the other hosts in the cluster. The
    other cluster nodes monitor this heartbeat. The heartbeat can be
    transmitted over many different systems, including shared network
    devices, dedicated network interfaces and serial connections.
    Failure to get a heartbeat from a node is treated as failure of the
    node. Although we don't know the reason for the failure (it could be
    an OS failure, a hardware failure in the server, or a failure in the
    network switch), it is safe to assume that if no heartbeat is
    produced there is a fault.
  </p><div class="figure"><a name="ha-heartbeat-overview"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 14.3. DRBD Architecture</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/ha-heartbeat-overview.png" alt="Heartbeat Architecture"></div></div><p>
    In addition to checking the heartbeat from the server, the system
    can also check the connectivity (using <span><strong class="command">ping</strong></span>) to
    another host on the network, such as the network router. This allows
    Heartbeat to detect a failure of communication between a server and
    the router (and therefore failure of the server, since it is no
    longer capable of providing the necessary service), even if the
    heartbeat between the servers in the clusters is working fine.
  </p><p>
    In the event of a failure, the resources on the failed host are
    disabled, and the resources on one of the replacement hosts is
    enabled instead. In addition, the Virtual IP address for the cluster
    is redirected to the new host in place of the failed device.
  </p><p>
    When used with MySQL and DRBD, the MySQL data is replicated from the
    master to the slave using the DRBD device, but MySQL is only running
    on the master. When the master fails, the slave switches the DRBD
    devices to be primary, the filesystems on those devices are mounted,
    and MySQL is started. The original master (if still available) has
    it's resources disabled, which means shutting down MySQL and
    unmounting the filesystems and switching the DRBD device to
    secondary.
  </p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ha-heartbeat-config"></a>14.2.1. Heartbeat Configuration</h3></div></div></div><p>
      Heartbeat configuration requires three files located in
      <code class="filename">/etc/ha.d</code>. The <code class="filename">ha.cf</code>
      contains the main heartbeat configuration, including the list of
      the nodes and times for identifying failures.
      <code class="filename">haresources</code> contains the list of resources to
      be managed within the cluster. The <code class="filename">authkeys</code>
      file contains the security information for the cluster.
    </p><p>
      The contents of these files should be identical on each host
      within the Heartbeat cluster. It's important that you keep these
      files in sync across all the hosts. Any changes in the information
      on one host should be copied to the all the others.
    </p><p>
      For these examples n example of the <code class="filename">ha.cf</code>
      file is shown below:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">logfacility local0
keepalive 500ms
deadtime 10
warntime 5
initdead 30
mcast bond0 225.0.0.1 694 2 0
mcast bond1 225.0.0.2 694 1 0
auto_failback off
node drbd1
node drbd2</pre><p>
      The individual lines in the file can be identified as follows:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
          <code class="literal">logfacility</code> — sets the logging, in
          this case setting the logging to use
          <span><strong class="command">syslog</strong></span>.
        </p></li><li><p>
          <code class="literal">keepalive</code> — defines how frequently
          the heartbeat signal is sent to the other hosts.
        </p></li><li><p>
          <code class="literal">deadtime</code>— the delay in seconds before
          other hosts in the cluster are considered 'dead' (failed).
        </p></li><li><p>
          <code class="literal">warntime</code> — the delay in seconds
          before a warning is written to the log that a node cannot be
          contacted.
        </p></li><li><p>
          <code class="literal">initdead</code> — the period in seconds to
          wait during system startup before the other host is considered
          to be down.
        </p></li><li><p>
          <code class="literal">mcast</code> — defines a method for sending
          a heartbeat signal. In the above example, a multicast network
          address is being used over a bonded network device. If you
          have multiple clusters then the multicast address for each
          cluster should be unique on your network. Other choices for
          the heartbeat exchange exist, including a serial connection.
        </p><p>
          If you are using multiple network interfaces (for example, one
          interface for your server connectivity and a secondary and/or
          bonded interface for your DRBD data exchange) then you should
          use both interfaces for your heartbeat connection. This
          decreases the chance of a transient failure causing a invalid
          failure event.
        </p></li><li><p>
          <code class="literal">auto_failback</code> — sets whether the
          original (preferred) server should be enabled again if it
          becomes available. Switching this to <code class="literal">on</code> may
          cause problems if the preferred went offline and then comes
          back on line again. If the DRBD device has not been synced
          properly, or if the problem with the original server happens
          again you may end up with two different datasets on the two
          servers, or with a continually changing environment where the
          two servers flip-flop as the preferred server reboots and then
          starts again.
        </p></li><li><p>
          <code class="literal">node</code> — sets the nodes within the
          Heartbeat cluster group. There should be one
          <code class="literal">node</code> for each server.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      An optional additional set of information provides the
      configuration for a ping test that will check the connectivity to
      another host. You should use this to ensure that you have
      connectivity on the public interface for your servers, so the ping
      test should be to a reliable host such as a router or switch. The
      additional lines specify the destination machine for the
      <code class="literal">ping</code>, which should be specified as an IP
      address, rather than a hostname; the command to run when a failure
      occurs, the authority for the failure and the timeout before an
      non-response triggers a failure. A sample configure is shown
      below:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">ping 10.0.0.1
respawn hacluster /usr/lib64/heartbeat/ipfail
apiauth ipfail gid=haclient uid=hacluster
deadping 5</pre><p>
      In the above example, the <span><strong class="command">ipfail</strong></span> command, which
      is part of the Heartbeat solution, is called on a failure and
      'fakes' a fault on the currently active server. You need to
      configure the user and group ID under which the command should be
      executed (using the <code class="literal">apiauth</code>). The failure will
      be triggered after 5 seconds.
    </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
        The <code class="literal">deadping</code> value must be less than the
        <code class="literal">deadtime</code> value.
      </p></div><p>
      The <code class="filename">authkeys</code> file holds the authorization
      information for the Heartbeat cluster. The authorization relies on
      a single unique 'key' that is used to verify the two machines in
      the Heartbeat cluster. The file is used only to confirm that the
      two machines are in the same cluster and is used to ensure that
      the multiple clusters can co-exist within the same network.
    </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ha-heartbeat-drbd"></a>14.2.2. Using Heartbeat with MySQL and DRBD</h3></div></div></div><p>
      To use Heartbeat in combination with MySQL you should be using
      DRBD (see <a href="ha-overview.html#ha-drbd" title="14.1. Using MySQL with DRBD for High Availability">Section 14.1, “Using MySQL with DRBD for High Availability”</a>) or another solution that
      allows for sharing of the MySQL database files in event of a
      system failure. In these examples, DRBD is used as the data
      sharing solution.
    </p><p>
      Heartbeat manages the configuration of different resources to
      manage the switching between two servers in the event of a
      failure. The resource configuration defines the individual
      services that should be brought up (or taken down) in the event of
      a failure.
    </p><p>
      The <code class="filename">haresources</code> file within
      <code class="filename">/etc/ha.d</code> defines the resources that should
      be managed, and the individual resource mentioned in this file in
      turn relates to scripts located within
      <code class="filename">/etc/ha.d/resource.d</code>. The resource definition
      is defined all on one line:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">drbd1 drbddisk Filesystem::/dev/drbd0::/drbd::ext3 mysql 10.0.0.100</pre><p>
      The line is notionally split by whitespace. The first entry
      (<code class="literal">drbd1</code>) is the name of the preferred host, i.e.
      the server that is normally responsible for handling the service.
      The last field is virtual IP address or name that should be used
      to share the service. This is the IP address that should be used
      to connect to the MySQL server. It will automatically be allocated
      to the server that is active when Heartbeat starts.
    </p><p>
      The remaining fields between these two fields define the resources
      that should be managed. Each Field should contain the name of the
      resource (and each name should refer to a script within
      <code class="filename">/etc/ha.d/resource.d</code>). In the event of a
      failure, these resources are started on the backup server by
      calling the corresponding script (with a single argument,
      <code class="literal">start</code>), in order from left to right. If there
      are additional arguments to the script, you can use a double colon
      to separate each additional argument.
    </p><p>
      In the above example, we manage the following resources:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
          <code class="literal">drbddisk</code> — the DRBD resource script,
          this will switch the DRBD disk on the secondary host into
          primary mode, making the device read/write.
        </p></li><li><p>
          <code class="literal">Filesystem</code> — manages the Filesystem
          resource. In this case we have supplied additional arguments
          to specify the DRBD device, mount point and filesystem type.
          When executed this should mount the specified filesystem.
        </p></li><li><p>
          <code class="literal">mysql</code> — manages the MySQL instances
          and starts the MySQL server. You should copy the
          <code class="filename">mysql.resource</code> file from the
          <code class="filename">support-files</code> directory from any MySQL
          release into the <code class="filename">/etc/ha.d/resources.d</code>
          directory.
        </p><p>
          If this file is not available in your distribution, you can
          use the following as the contents of the
          <code class="filename">/etc/ha.d/resource.d/mysql.resource</code> file:

      both primary and secondary servers.
    </p><p>
      You can test the configuration by running a manual failover,
      connect to the primary node and run:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">root-shell&gt; /usr/lib64/heartbeat/hb_standby</pre><p>
      This will cause the current node to relinquish its resources
      cleanly to the other node.

      As a further extension to using DRBD and Heartbeat together, you
      can enable <span><strong class="command">dopd</strong></span>. The <span><strong class="command">dopd</strong></span>
      daemon handles the situation where a DRBD node is out of date
      compared to the master and prevents the slave from being promoted
      to master in the event of a failure. This stops a situation where
      you have two machines that have been masters ending up different
      data on the underlying device.
    </p><p>
      For example, imagine that you have a two server DRBD setup, master
      and slave. If the DRBD connectivity between master and slave fails
      then the slave would be out of the sync with the master. If
      Heartbeat identifies a connectivity issue for master and then
      switches over to the slave, the slave DRBD device will be promoted
      to the primary device, even though the data on the slave and the
      master is not in synchronization.
    </p><p>
      In this situation, with <span><strong class="command">dopd</strong></span> enabled, the
      connectivity failure between the master and slave would be
      identified and the metadata on the slave wold be set to
      <code class="literal">Outdated</code>. Heartbeat will then refuse to switch
      over to the slave even if the master failed. In a dual-host
      solution this would effectively render the cluster out of action,
      as there is no additional fail over server. In an HA cluster with
      three or more servers, control would be passed to the slave that
      has an up to date version of the DRBD device data.
    </p><p>
      To enable <span><strong class="command">dopd</strong></span>, you need to modify the
      Heartbeat configuration and specify <span><strong class="command">dopd</strong></span> as
      part of the commands executed during the monitoring process. Add
      the following lines to your <code class="filename">ha.cf</code> file:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">respawn hacluster /usr/lib/heartbeat/dopd  
apiauth dopd gid=haclient uid=hacluster</pre><p>
      Make sure you make the same modification on both your primary and
      secondary nodes.
    </p><p>
      You will need to reload the Heartbeat configuration:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">root-shell&gt; /etc/init.d/heartbeat reload</pre><p>
      You will also need to modify your DRBD configuration by
      configuration the <code class="literal">outdate-peer</code> option. You will
      need to add the configuration line into the
      <code class="literal">common</code> section of
      <code class="filename">/etc/drbd.conf</code> on both hosts. An example of
      the full block is shown below:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">common {  
  handlers {  
    outdate-peer "/usr/lib/heartbeat/drbd-peer-outdater";  
  }  
}</pre><p>
      Finally, set the <code class="literal">fencing</code> option on your DRBD
      configured resources:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">resource my-resource {  
  disk {  
    fencing    resource-only;  
  }
}</pre><p>
      Now reload your DRBD configuration:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">root-shell&gt; drbdadmin adjust all</pre><p>
      You can test the system by unplugging your DRBD link and
      monitoring the output from <code class="filename">/proc/drbd</code>.
    </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ha-heartbeat-errors"></a>14.2.4. Dealing with System Level Errors</h3></div></div></div><p>
      Because a kernel panic or oops may indicate potential problem with
      your server, you should configure your server to remove itself
      from the cluster in the event of a problem. Typically on a kernel
      panic your system will automatically trigger a hard reboot. For a
      kernel oops a reboot may not happen automatically, but the issue
      that caused that oops may still lead to potential problems.
    </p><p>
      You can force a reboot by setting the
      <code class="literal">kernel.panic</code> and
      <code class="literal">kernel.panic_on_oops</code> parameters of the kernel
      control file <code class="filename">/etc/sysctl.conf</code>. For example:
    </p><pre class="programlisting"> kernel.panic_on_oops = 1
 kernel.panic = 1
  </pre><p>
      You can also set these parameters during runtime by using the
      <span><strong class="command">sysctl</strong></span> command. You can either specify the
      parameters on the command line:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">$ sysctl -w kernel.panic=1
  </pre><p>
      Or you can edit your <code class="filename">sysctl.conf</code> file and
      then reload the configuration information:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">$ sysctl -p
 </pre><p>
      By setting both these parameters to a positive value (actually the
      number of seconds to wait before triggering the reboot), the
      system will reboot. Your second heartbeat node should then detect
      that the server is down and then switch over to the failover host.

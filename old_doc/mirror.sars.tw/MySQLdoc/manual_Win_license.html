<p>This License applies to the computer program known as &quot;MySQL&quot;. </p>

<p>This License applies when running MySQL on any Microsoft operating system. Microsoft 
operating systems include all versions of Microsoft Windows NT and Microsoft Windows. </p>

<p>YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS BEFORE USING, COPYING OR 
DISTRIBUTING MySQL. BY USING, COPYING AND DISTRIBUTING MySQL, YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE 
OF THIS LICENSE TO DO SO, AND ALL ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USING, COPYING AND 
DISTRIBUTING MySQL OR WORKS BASED ON IT. NOTHING OTHER THAN THIS LICENSE GRANTS YOU

<ol>
  <li>Evaluation and License Registration. This is an evaluation version of MySQL for Win32. 
    Subject to the terms below, you are hereby licensed to use MySQL for evaluation purposes 
    without charge for a period of 30 days. If you use MySQL after the 30 day evaluation 
    period the registration and purchase of a MySQL license is required. The price for a MySQL 
    license is currently 200 US dollars and email support starts from 200 US dollars/year. 
    Quantity discounts are available. If you pay by credit card, the currency is EURO (The 
    European Unions common currency) so the prices will differ slightly. The easiest way to 
    register or find options about how to pay for MySQL is to use the license form at TcX's 
    secure server at <a HREF="https://www.mysql.com/license.htmy">https://www.mysql.com/license.htmy</a>. 
    This can be used also when paying with credit card over the Internet. Other applicable 
    methods for paying are SWIFT payments, cheques and credit cards. Payment should be made 
    to: <pre>

    <p>For more about the license prices and commercial support, like email support, please 
    refer to the MySQL manual. See section <a HREF="manual_Licensing_and_Support.html#Cost">3.5 
    MySQL licensing and support costs</a>. See section <a
    HREF="manual_Licensing_and_Support.html#Support">3.6 Types of commercial support</a>. The 
    use of MySQL or any work based on MySQL after the 30-day evaluation period is in violation 
    of international copyright laws. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Registered version of MySQL. After you have purchased a MySQL license we will send you a 
    receipt by paper mail. You are allowed to use MySQL or any work based on MySQL after the 
    30-days evaluation period. The use of MySQL is, however, restricted to one physical 
    computer, but there are no restrictions on concurrent uses of MySQL or the number of MySQL 
    servers run on the computer. We will also email you an address and password for a 
    password-protected WWW page that always has the newest MySQL-Win32 version. Our current 
    policy is that a user with the MySQL license can get free upgrades. The best way to ensure 
    that you get the best possible support is to purchase commercial support! </li>
  <li>Registration for use in education and university or government-sponsored research. You 
    may obtain a MySQL license for the use in education and university or government-sponsored 
    research for free. In that case, send a detailed application for licensing MySQL for such 
    use to the email address The following information is required in the application: <ul>
      <li>The name of the school or institute. </li>
      <li>A short description of the school or institute and of the type of education, resarch or 
        other functions it provides. </li>
      <li>A detailed report of the use of MySQL in the institution. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In this case you will be provided with a license that entitles you to use MySQL in a 
    specified manner. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Distribution. Provided that you verify that you are distributing an evaluation or 
    educational/research version of MySQL you are hereby licensed to make as many literal 
    (i.e., verbatim) copies of the evaluation version of MySQL and documentation as you wish. </li>
  <li>Restrictions. The client code of MySQL is in the Public Domain or under the GPL (for 
    example the code for readline) license. You are not allowed to modify, recompile, 
    translate or create derivative works based upon any part of the server code of MySQL. </li>
  <li>Reservation of Rights. No rights are granted to MySQL except as expressly set forth 
    herein. You may not copy or distribute MySQL except as expressly provided under this 
    License. Any attempt otherwise to copy or distribute MySQL is void, and will automatically 
    terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or 
    rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as 
    such parties remain in full compliance. </li>
  <li>Other Restrictions. If the distribution and/or use of MySQL is restricted in certain 
    countries for any reason, the Licensor may add an explicit geographical distribution 
    limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among 
    countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if 
    written in the body of this License. </li>
  <li>Limitations. MySQL IS PROVIDED TO YOU &quot;AS IS,&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY. THERE IS NO 
    WARRANTY FOR MySQL, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE 
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND 
    NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE 
    OF MySQL IS WITH YOU. SHOULD MySQL PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY 
    SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED 
    TO IN WRITING WILL THE LICENSOR, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE 
    MySQL AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, 
    INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE MySQL 
    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES 
    SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF MySQL TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER 
    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
    DAMAGES. </li>

<h1><a href="manual_toc.html#Unireg" name="Unireg">I What is Unireg?</a></h1>

<p>Unireg is our tty interface builder, but it uses a low level connection to our ISAM 
(which is used by <strong>MySQL</strong>) and because of this it is very quick. It has 
existed since 1979 (on Unix in C since ~1986). </p>

<p>Unireg has the following components: 

<ul>
  <li>One table viewer with updates/browsing. </li>
  <li>Multi table viewer (with one scrolling region). </li>
  <li>Table creator. (With lots of column tags you can't create with <strong>MySQL</strong>) 
    This is WYSIWYG (for a tty). You design a screen and Unireg prompts for the column 
    specification. </li>
  <li>Report generator. </li>
  <li>A lot of utilities (quick export/import of tables to/from text files, analysis of table 
    contents...). </li>
  <li>Powerful multi-table updates (which we use a lot) with a BASIC-like language with LOTS 
    of functions. </li>
  <li>Dynamic languages (at present in Swedish and Finnish). If somebody wants an English 
    version there are a few files that would have to be translated. </li>
  <li>The ability to run updates interactively or in a batch. </li>
  <li>Emacs-like key definitions with keyboard macros. </li>
  <li>All this in a binary of 800K. </li>
  <li>The <code>convform</code> utility. Converts <tt>`.frm'</tt> and text files between 
    different character sets. </li>
  <li>The <code>myisampack</code> utility. Packs a ISAM table (makes it 50-80% smaller). The 
    table can be read by <strong>MySQL</strong> like an ordinary table. Only one record has to 
    be decompressed per access. Cannot handle <code>BLOB</code> or <code>TEXT</code> columns 
    or updates (yet). </li>
</ul>

<p>We update most of our production databases with the Unireg interface and serve web 
pages through <strong>MySQL</strong> (and in some extreme cases the Unireg report 
generator). </p>

<p>Unireg takes about 3M of disk space and works on at least the following platforms: 
SunOS 4.x, Solaris, Linux, HP-UX, ICL Unix, DNIX, SCO and MS-DOS. </p>

<p>Unireg is currently only available in Swedish and Finnish. </p>

<p>The price tag for Unireg is 10,000 Swedish kr (about $1500 US), but this includes 
support. Unireg is distributed as a binary. (But all the ISAM sources can be found in <strong>MySQL</strong>). 
Usually we compile the binary for the customer at their site. </p>

<p>All new development is concentrated to <strong>MySQL</strong>. </p>

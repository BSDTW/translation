<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="SECURING-ROOT-AND-STAFF" name="SECURING-ROOT-AND-STAFF">14.3.1
Securing the <tt class="USERNAME">root</tt> Account and Staff Accounts</a></h2>

<p>First off, do not bother securing staff accounts if you have not secured the <tt
class="USERNAME">root</tt> account. Most systems have a password assigned to the <tt
class="USERNAME">root</tt> account. The first thing you do is assume that the password is
<span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">always</i></span> compromised. This does not
mean that you should remove the password. The password is almost always necessary for
console access to the machine. What it does mean is that you should not make it possible
to use the password outside of the console or possibly even with the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=su&amp;sektion=1"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">su</span>(1)</span></a> command. For
example, make sure that your ptys are specified as being insecure in the <tt
class="FILENAME">/etc/ttys</tt> file so that direct <tt class="USERNAME">root</tt> logins
via <tt class="COMMAND">telnet</tt> or <tt class="COMMAND">rlogin</tt> are disallowed. If
using other login services such as <b class="APPLICATION">sshd</b>, make sure that direct
<tt class="USERNAME">root</tt> logins are disabled there as well. You can do this by
editing your <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt> file, and making sure that
<tt class="LITERAL">PermitRootLogin</tt> is set to <tt class="LITERAL">NO</tt>. Consider
every access method -- services such as FTP often fall through the cracks. Direct <tt
class="USERNAME">root</tt> logins should only be allowed via the system console.</p>

<p>Of course, as a sysadmin you have to be able to get to <tt class="USERNAME">root</tt>,
so we open up a few holes. But we make sure these holes require additional password
verification to operate. One way to make <tt class="USERNAME">root</tt> accessible is to
add appropriate staff accounts to the <tt class="GROUPNAME">wheel</tt> group (in <tt
class="FILENAME">/etc/group</tt>). The staff members placed in the <tt
class="GROUPNAME">wheel</tt> group are allowed to <tt class="COMMAND">su</tt> to <tt
class="USERNAME">root</tt>. You should never give staff members native <tt
class="GROUPNAME">wheel</tt> access by putting them in the <tt
class="GROUPNAME">wheel</tt> group in their password entry. Staff accounts should be
placed in a <tt class="GROUPNAME">staff</tt> group, and then added to the <tt
class="GROUPNAME">wheel</tt> group via the <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/group</tt> file.
Only those staff members who actually need to have <tt class="USERNAME">root</tt> access
should be placed in the <tt class="GROUPNAME">wheel</tt> group. It is also possible, when
using an authentication method such as Kerberos, to use Kerberos' <tt
class="FILENAME">.k5login</tt> file in the <tt class="USERNAME">root</tt> account to
allow a <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ksu&amp;sektion=1"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">ksu</span>(1)</span></a> to <tt
class="USERNAME">root</tt> without having to place anyone at all in the <tt
class="GROUPNAME">wheel</tt> group. This may be the better solution since the <tt
class="GROUPNAME">wheel</tt> mechanism still allows an intruder to break <tt
class="USERNAME">root</tt> if the intruder has gotten hold of your password file and can
break into a staff account. While having the <tt class="GROUPNAME">wheel</tt> mechanism
is better than having nothing at all, it is not necessarily the safest option.</p>

<p>An indirect way to secure staff accounts, and ultimately <tt
class="USERNAME">root</tt> access is to use an alternative login access method and do
what is known as “starring” out the encrypted password for the staff accounts. Using
the <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=vipw&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">vipw</span>(8)</span></a> command, one
can replace each instance of an encrypted password with a single “<tt
class="LITERAL">*</tt>” character. This command will update the <tt
class="FILENAME">/etc/master.passwd</tt> file and user/password database to disable
password-authenticated logins.</p>

<p>A staff account entry such as:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
foobar:R9DT/Fa1/LV9U:1000:1000::0:0:Foo Bar:/home/foobar:/usr/local/bin/tcsh
</pre>

<p>Should be changed to this:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
foobar:*:1000:1000::0:0:Foo Bar:/home/foobar:/usr/local/bin/tcsh
</pre>

<p>This change will prevent normal logins from occurring, since the encrypted password
will never match “<tt class="LITERAL">*</tt>”. With this done, staff members must use
another mechanism to authenticate themselves such as <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=kerberos&amp;sektion=1"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">kerberos</span>(1)</span></a> or <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ssh&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.4">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">ssh</span>(1)</span></a> using a
public/private key pair. When using something like Kerberos, one generally must secure
the machines which run the Kerberos servers and your desktop workstation. When using a
public/private key pair with ssh, one must generally secure the machine used to login
<span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">from</i></span> (typically one's workstation).
An additional layer of protection can be added to the key pair by password protecting the
key pair when creating it with <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ssh-keygen&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.4">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">ssh-keygen</span>(1)</span></a>.
Being able to “star” out the passwords for staff accounts also guarantees that staff
members can only login through secure access methods that you have set up. This forces
all staff members to use secure, encrypted connections for all of their sessions, which
closes an important hole used by many intruders: sniffing the network from an unrelated,
less secure machine.</p>

<p>The more indirect security mechanisms also assume that you are logging in from a more
restrictive server to a less restrictive server. For example, if your main box is running
all sorts of servers, your workstation should not be running any. In order for your
workstation to be reasonably secure you should run as few servers as possible, up to and
including no servers at all, and you should run a password-protected screen blanker. Of
course, given physical access to a workstation an attacker can break any sort of security
you put on it. This is definitely a problem that you should consider, but you should also
consider the fact that the vast majority of break-ins occur remotely, over a network,
from people who do not have physical access to your workstation or servers.</p>

<p>Using something like Kerberos also gives you the ability to disable or change the
password for a staff account in one place, and have it immediately affect all the
machines on which the staff member may have an account. If a staff member's account gets
compromised, the ability to instantly change his password on all machines should not be
underrated. With discrete passwords, changing a password on N machines can be a mess. You
can also impose re-passwording restrictions with Kerberos: not only can a Kerberos ticket
be made to timeout after a while, but the Kerberos system can require that the user
choose a new password after a certain period of time (say, once a month).</p>

<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN19140" name="AEN19140">14.3.2 Securing Root-run Servers and
SUID/SGID Binaries</a></h2>

<p>The prudent sysadmin only runs the servers he needs to, no more, no less. Be aware
that third party servers are often the most bug-prone. For example, running an old
version of <b class="APPLICATION">imapd</b> or <b class="APPLICATION">popper</b> is like
giving a universal <tt class="USERNAME">root</tt> ticket out to the entire world. Never
run a server that you have not checked out carefully. Many servers do not need to be run
as <tt class="USERNAME">root</tt>. For example, the <b class="APPLICATION">ntalk</b>, <b
class="APPLICATION">comsat</b>, and <b class="APPLICATION">finger</b> daemons can be run
in special user <i class="FIRSTTERM">sandboxes</i>. A sandbox is not perfect, unless you
go through a large amount of trouble, but the onion approach to security still stands: If
someone is able to break in through a server running in a sandbox, they still have to
break out of the sandbox. The more layers the attacker must break through, the lower the
likelihood of his success. Root holes have historically been found in virtually every
server ever run as <tt class="USERNAME">root</tt>, including basic system servers. If you
are running a machine through which people only login via <b class="APPLICATION">sshd</b>
and never login via <b class="APPLICATION">telnetd</b> or <b class="APPLICATION">rshd</b>
or <b class="APPLICATION">rlogind</b>, then turn off those services!</p>

<p>FreeBSD now defaults to running <b class="APPLICATION">ntalkd</b>, <b
class="APPLICATION">comsat</b>, and <b class="APPLICATION">finger</b> in a sandbox.
Another program which may be a candidate for running in a sandbox is <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=named&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">named</span>(8)</span></a>. <tt
class="FILENAME">/etc/defaults/rc.conf</tt> includes the arguments necessary to run <b
class="APPLICATION">named</b> in a sandbox in a commented-out form. Depending on whether
you are installing a new system or upgrading an existing system, the special user
accounts used by these sandboxes may not be installed. The prudent sysadmin would
research and implement sandboxes for servers whenever possible.</p>

<p>There are a number of other servers that typically do not run in sandboxes: <b
class="APPLICATION">sendmail</b>, <b class="APPLICATION">popper</b>, <b
class="APPLICATION">imapd</b>, <b class="APPLICATION">ftpd</b>, and others. There are
alternatives to some of these, but installing them may require more work than you are
willing to perform (the convenience factor strikes again). You may have to run these
servers as <tt class="USERNAME">root</tt> and rely on other mechanisms to detect
break-ins that might occur through them.</p>

<p>The other big potential <tt class="USERNAME">root</tt> holes in a system are the
suid-root and sgid binaries installed on the system. Most of these binaries, such as <b
class="APPLICATION">rlogin</b>, reside in <tt class="FILENAME">/bin</tt>, <tt
class="FILENAME">/sbin</tt>, <tt class="FILENAME">/usr/bin</tt>, or <tt
class="FILENAME">/usr/sbin</tt>. While nothing is 100% safe, the system-default suid and
sgid binaries can be considered reasonably safe. Still, <tt class="USERNAME">root</tt>
holes are occasionally found in these binaries. A <tt class="USERNAME">root</tt> hole was
found in <tt class="LITERAL">Xlib</tt> in 1998 that made <b class="APPLICATION">xterm</b>
(which is typically suid) vulnerable. It is better to be safe than sorry and the prudent
sysadmin will restrict suid binaries, that only staff should run, to a special group that
only staff can access, and get rid of (<tt class="COMMAND">chmod 000</tt>) any suid
binaries that nobody uses. A server with no display generally does not need an <b
class="APPLICATION">xterm</b> binary. Sgid binaries can be almost as dangerous. If an
intruder can break an sgid-kmem binary, the intruder might be able to read <tt
class="FILENAME">/dev/kmem</tt> and thus read the encrypted password file, potentially
compromising any passworded account. Alternatively an intruder who breaks group <tt
class="LITERAL">kmem</tt> can monitor keystrokes sent through ptys, including ptys used
by users who login through secure methods. An intruder that breaks the <tt
class="GROUPNAME">tty</tt> group can write to almost any user's tty. If a user is running
a terminal program or emulator with a keyboard-simulation feature, the intruder can
potentially generate a data stream that causes the user's terminal to echo a command,
which is then run as that user.</p>

<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="SECURE-USERS" name="SECURE-USERS">14.3.3 Securing User
Accounts</a></h2>

<p>User accounts are usually the most difficult to secure. While you can impose Draconian
access restrictions on your staff and “star” out their passwords, you may not be able
to do so with any general user accounts you might have. If you do have sufficient
control, then you may win out and be able to secure the user accounts properly. If not,
you simply have to be more vigilant in your monitoring of those accounts. Use of ssh and
Kerberos for user accounts is more problematic, due to the extra administration and
technical support required, but still a very good solution compared to a crypted password
file.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT2">
<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN19217" name="AEN19217">14.3.4 Securing the Password
File</a></h2>

<p>The only sure fire way is to <tt class="LITERAL">*</tt> out as many passwords as you
can and use ssh or Kerberos for access to those accounts. Even though the encrypted
password file (<tt class="FILENAME">/etc/spwd.db</tt>) can only be read by <tt
class="USERNAME">root</tt>, it may be possible for an intruder to obtain read access to
that file even if the attacker cannot obtain root-write access.</p>

<p>Your security scripts should always check for and report changes to the password file
(see the <a href="securing-freebsd.html#SECURITY-INTEGRITY">Checking file integrity</a>
section below).</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT2">
<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN19225" name="AEN19225">14.3.5 Securing the Kernel Core, Raw
Devices, and File systems</a></h2>

<p>If an attacker breaks <tt class="USERNAME">root</tt> he can do just about anything,
but there are certain conveniences. For example, most modern kernels have a packet
sniffing device driver built in. Under FreeBSD it is called the <tt
class="DEVICENAME">bpf</tt> device. An intruder will commonly attempt to run a packet
sniffer on a compromised machine. You do not need to give the intruder the capability and
most systems do not have the need for the <tt class="DEVICENAME">bpf</tt> device compiled
in.</p>

<p>But even if you turn off the <tt class="DEVICENAME">bpf</tt> device, you still have
<tt class="FILENAME">/dev/mem</tt> and <tt class="FILENAME">/dev/kmem</tt> to worry
about. For that matter, the intruder can still write to raw disk devices. Also, there is
another kernel feature called the module loader, <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=kldload&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">kldload</span>(8)</span></a>. An
enterprising intruder can use a KLD module to install his own <tt
class="DEVICENAME">bpf</tt> device, or other sniffing device, on a running kernel. To
avoid these problems you have to run the kernel at a higher secure level, at least
securelevel 1. The securelevel can be set with a <tt class="COMMAND">sysctl</tt> on the
<code class="VARNAME">kern.securelevel</code> variable. Once you have set the securelevel
to 1, write access to raw devices will be denied and special <tt
class="COMMAND">chflags</tt> flags, such as <tt class="LITERAL">schg</tt>, will be
enforced. You must also ensure that the <tt class="LITERAL">schg</tt> flag is set on
critical startup binaries, directories, and script files -- everything that gets run up
to the point where the securelevel is set. This might be overdoing it, and upgrading the
system is much more difficult when you operate at a higher secure level. You may
compromise and run the system at a higher secure level but not set the <tt
class="LITERAL">schg</tt> flag for every system file and directory under the sun. Another
possibility is to simply mount <tt class="FILENAME">/</tt> and <tt
class="FILENAME">/usr</tt> read-only. It should be noted that being too Draconian in what
you attempt to protect may prevent the all-important detection of an intrusion.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT2">
<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="SECURITY-INTEGRITY" name="SECURITY-INTEGRITY">14.3.6 Checking
File Integrity: Binaries, Configuration Files, Etc.</a></h2>

<p>When it comes right down to it, you can only protect your core system configuration
and control files so much before the convenience factor rears its ugly head. For example,
using <tt class="COMMAND">chflags</tt> to set the <tt class="LITERAL">schg</tt> bit on
most of the files in <tt class="FILENAME">/</tt> and <tt class="FILENAME">/usr</tt> is
probably counterproductive, because while it may protect the files, it also closes a
detection window. The last layer of your security onion is perhaps the most important --
detection. The rest of your security is pretty much useless (or, worse, presents you with
a false sense of safety) if you cannot detect potential incursions. Half the job of the
onion is to slow down the attacker, rather than stop him, in order to give the detection
side of the equation a chance to catch him in the act.</p>

<p>The best way to detect an incursion is to look for modified, missing, or unexpected
files. The best way to look for modified files is from another (often centralized)
limited-access system. Writing your security scripts on the extra-secure limited-access
system makes them mostly invisible to potential attackers, and this is important. In
order to take maximum advantage you generally have to give the limited-access box
significant access to the other machines in the business, usually either by doing a
read-only NFS export of the other machines to the limited-access box, or by setting up
ssh key-pairs to allow the limited-access box to ssh to the other machines. Except for
its network traffic, NFS is the least visible method -- allowing you to monitor the file
systems on each client box virtually undetected. If your limited-access server is
connected to the client boxes through a switch, the NFS method is often the better
choice. If your limited-access server is connected to the client boxes through a hub, or
through several layers of routing, the NFS method may be too insecure (network-wise) and
using ssh may be the better choice even with the audit-trail tracks that ssh lays.</p>

<p>Once you give a limited-access box, at least read access to the client systems it is
supposed to monitor, you must write scripts to do the actual monitoring. Given an NFS
mount, you can write scripts out of simple system utilities such as <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=find&amp;sektion=1"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">find</span>(1)</span></a> and <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=md5&amp;sektion=1"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">md5</span>(1)</span></a>. It is best to
physically md5 the client-box files at least once a day, and to test control files such
as those found in <tt class="FILENAME">/etc</tt> and <tt
class="FILENAME">/usr/local/etc</tt> even more often. When mismatches are found, relative
to the base md5 information the limited-access machine knows is valid, it should scream
at a sysadmin to go check it out. A good security script will also check for
inappropriate suid binaries and for new or deleted files on system partitions such as <tt
class="FILENAME">/</tt> and <tt class="FILENAME">/usr</tt>.</p>

<p>When using ssh rather than NFS, writing the security script is much more difficult.
You essentially have to <tt class="COMMAND">scp</tt> the scripts to the client box in
order to run them, making them visible, and for safety you also need to <tt
class="COMMAND">scp</tt> the binaries (such as find) that those scripts use. The <b
class="APPLICATION">ssh</b> client on the client box may already be compromised. All in
all, using ssh may be necessary when running over insecure links, but it is also a lot
harder to deal with.</p>

<p>A good security script will also check for changes to user and staff members access
configuration files: <tt class="FILENAME">.rhosts</tt>, <tt
class="FILENAME">.shosts</tt>, <tt class="FILENAME">.ssh/authorized_keys</tt> and so
forth... files that might fall outside the purview of the <tt class="LITERAL">MD5</tt>
check.</p>

<p>If you have a huge amount of user disk space, it may take too long to run through
every file on those partitions. In this case, setting mount flags to disallow suid
binaries and devices on those partitions is a good idea. The <tt
class="LITERAL">nodev</tt> and <tt class="LITERAL">nosuid</tt> options (see <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mount&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">mount</span>(8)</span></a>) are what you
want to look into. You should probably scan them anyway, at least once a week, since the
object of this layer is to detect a break-in whether or not the break-in is
effective.</p>

<p>Process accounting (see <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=accton&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">accton</span>(8)</span></a>) is a
relatively low-overhead feature of the operating system which might help as a
post-break-in evaluation mechanism. It is especially useful in tracking down how an
intruder has actually broken into a system, assuming the file is still intact after the
break-in occurs.</p>

<p>Finally, security scripts should process the log files, and the logs themselves should
be generated in as secure a manner as possible -- remote syslog can be very useful. An
intruder tries to cover his tracks, and log files are critical to the sysadmin trying to
track down the time and method of the initial break-in. One way to keep a permanent
record of the log files is to run the system console to a serial port and collect the
information on a continuing basis through a secure machine monitoring the consoles.</p>

<p>這一節將介紹服務阻斷攻擊。 DoS 攻擊通常是以封包的方式進行攻擊，
儘管幾乎沒有任何辦法來阻止大量的偽造封包耗盡網路資源，
但通常可以透過一些方式來降低這類攻擊的損害，使它們無法擊垮伺服器。</p>

<p>Limiting springboard attacks (ICMP response 攻擊，ping broadcast等等)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Kernel Route Cache.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>A common DoS attack is against a forking server that attempts to cause the server to
eat processes, file descriptors, and memory, until the machine dies. <b
class="APPLICATION">inetd</b> (see <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=inetd&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">inetd</span>(8)</span></a>) has several
options to limit this sort of attack. It should be noted that while it is possible to
prevent a machine from going down, it is not generally possible to prevent a service from
being disrupted by the attack. Read the <b class="APPLICATION">inetd</b> manual page
carefully and pay specific attention to the <code class="OPTION">-c</code>, <code
class="OPTION">-C</code>, and <code class="OPTION">-R</code> options. Note that
spoofed-IP attacks will circumvent the <code class="OPTION">-C</code> option to <b
class="APPLICATION">inetd</b>, so typically a combination of options must be used. Some
standalone servers have self-fork-limitation parameters.</p>

<p><b class="APPLICATION">Sendmail</b> has its <code
class="OPTION">-OMaxDaemonChildren</code> option, which tends to work much better than
trying to use sendmail's load limiting options due to the load lag. You should specify a
<tt class="LITERAL">MaxDaemonChildren</tt> parameter, when you start <b
class="APPLICATION">sendmail</b>, high enough to handle your expected load, but not so
high that the computer cannot handle that number of <b class="APPLICATION">sendmails</b>
without falling on its face. It is also prudent to run sendmail in queued mode (<code
class="OPTION">-ODeliveryMode=queued</code>) and to run the daemon (<tt
class="COMMAND">sendmail -bd</tt>) separate from the queue-runs (<tt
class="COMMAND">sendmail -q15m</tt>). If you still want real-time delivery you can run
the queue at a much lower interval, such as <code class="OPTION">-q1m</code>, but be sure
to specify a reasonable <tt class="LITERAL">MaxDaemonChildren</tt> option for <span
class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">that</i></span> sendmail to prevent cascade
failures.</p>

<p><b class="APPLICATION">Syslogd</b> can be attacked directly and it is strongly
recommended that you use the <code class="OPTION">-s</code> option whenever possible, and
the <code class="OPTION">-a</code> option otherwise.</p>

<p>You should also be fairly careful with connect-back services such as <b
class="APPLICATION">TCP Wrapper</b>'s reverse-identd, which can be attacked directly. You
generally do not want to use the reverse-ident feature of <b class="APPLICATION">TCP
Wrapper</b> for this reason.</p>

<p>It is a very good idea to protect internal services from external access by
firewalling them off at your border routers. The idea here is to prevent saturation
attacks from outside your LAN, not so much to protect internal services from
network-based <tt class="USERNAME">root</tt> compromise. Always configure an exclusive
firewall, i.e., “firewall everything <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">except</i></span> ports A, B, C, D, and M-Z”. This way you can firewall
off all of your low ports except for certain specific services such as <b
class="APPLICATION">named</b> (if you are primary for a zone), <b
class="APPLICATION">ntalkd</b>, <b class="APPLICATION">sendmail</b>, and other
Internet-accessible services. If you try to configure the firewall the other way -- as an
inclusive or permissive firewall, there is a good chance that you will forget to
“close” a couple of services, or that you will add a new internal service and forget to
update the firewall. You can still open up the high-numbered port range on the firewall,
to allow permissive-like operation, without compromising your low ports. Also take note
that FreeBSD allows you to control the range of port numbers used for dynamic binding,
via the various <code class="VARNAME">net.inet.ip.portrange</code> <tt
class="COMMAND">sysctl</tt>'s (<tt class="COMMAND">sysctl -a | fgrep portrange</tt>),
which can also ease the complexity of your firewall's configuration. For example, you
might use a normal first/last range of 4000 to 5000, and a hiport range of 49152 to
65535, then block off everything under 4000 in your firewall (except for certain specific
Internet-accessible ports, of course).</p>

<p>Another common DoS attack is called a springboard attack -- to attack a server in a
manner that causes the server to generate responses which overloads the server, the local
network, or some other machine. The most common attack of this nature is the <span
class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">ICMP ping broadcast attack</i></span>. The attacker
spoofs ping packets sent to your LAN's broadcast address with the source IP address set
to the actual machine they wish to attack. If your border routers are not configured to
stomp on ping's to broadcast addresses, your LAN winds up generating sufficient responses
to the spoofed source address to saturate the victim, especially when the attacker uses
the same trick on several dozen broadcast addresses over several dozen different networks
at once. Broadcast attacks of over a hundred and twenty megabits have been measured. A
second common springboard attack is against the ICMP error reporting system. By
constructing packets that generate ICMP error responses, an attacker can saturate a
server's incoming network and cause the server to saturate its outgoing network with ICMP
responses. This type of attack can also crash the server by running it out of mbuf's,
especially if the server cannot drain the ICMP responses it generates fast enough.
FreeBSD 4.X kernels have a kernel compile option called <code
class="OPTION">ICMP_BANDLIM</code> which limits the effectiveness of these sorts of
attacks. Later kernels use the <b class="APPLICATION">sysctl</b> variable <tt
class="LITERAL">net.inet.icmp.icmplim</tt>. The last major class of springboard attacks
is related to certain internal <b class="APPLICATION">inetd</b> services such as the udp
echo service. An attacker simply spoofs a UDP packet with the source address being server
A's echo port, and the destination address being server B's echo port, where server A and
B are both on your LAN. The two servers then bounce this one packet back and forth
between each other. The attacker can overload both servers and their LANs simply by
injecting a few packets in this manner. Similar problems exist with the internal <b
class="APPLICATION">chargen</b> port. A competent sysadmin will turn off all of these
inetd-internal test services.</p>

<p>Spoofed packet attacks may also be used to overload the kernel route cache. Refer to
the <code class="VARNAME">net.inet.ip.rtexpire</code>, <code
class="VARNAME">rtminexpire</code>, and <code class="VARNAME">rtmaxcache</code> <tt
class="COMMAND">sysctl</tt> parameters. A spoofed packet attack that uses a random source
IP will cause the kernel to generate a temporary cached route in the route table,
viewable with <tt class="COMMAND">netstat -rna | fgrep W3</tt>. These routes typically
timeout in 1600 seconds or so. If the kernel detects that the cached route table has
gotten too big it will dynamically reduce the <code class="VARNAME">rtexpire</code> but
will never decrease it to less than <code class="VARNAME">rtminexpire</code>. There are
two problems:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>The kernel does not react quickly enough when a lightly loaded server is suddenly
attacked.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The <code class="VARNAME">rtminexpire</code> is not low enough for the kernel to
survive a sustained attack.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>If your servers are connected to the Internet via a T3 or better, it may be prudent to
manually override both <code class="VARNAME">rtexpire</code> and <code
class="VARNAME">rtminexpire</code> via <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sysctl&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">sysctl</span>(8)</span></a>. Never set
either parameter to zero (unless you want to crash the machine). Setting both parameters
to 2 seconds should be sufficient to protect the route table from attack.</p>

<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN19373" name="AEN19373">14.3.9 Access Issues with Kerberos and
SSH</a></h2>

<p>There are a few issues with both Kerberos and ssh that need to be addressed if you
intend to use them. Kerberos V is an excellent authentication protocol, but there are
bugs in the kerberized <b class="APPLICATION">telnet</b> and <b
class="APPLICATION">rlogin</b> applications that make them unsuitable for dealing with
binary streams. Also, by default Kerberos does not encrypt a session unless you use the
<code class="OPTION">-x</code> option. <b class="APPLICATION">ssh</b> encrypts everything
by default.</p>

<p>ssh works quite well in every respect except that it forwards encryption keys by
default. What this means is that if you have a secure workstation holding keys that give
you access to the rest of the system, and you ssh to an insecure machine, your keys are
usable. The actual keys themselves are not exposed, but ssh installs a forwarding port
for the duration of your login, and if an attacker has broken <tt
class="USERNAME">root</tt> on the insecure machine he can utilize that port to use your
keys to gain access to any other machine that your keys unlock.</p>

<p>We recommend that you use ssh in combination with Kerberos whenever possible for staff
logins. <b class="APPLICATION">ssh</b> can be compiled with Kerberos support. This
reduces your reliance on potentially exposed ssh keys while at the same time protecting
passwords via Kerberos. ssh keys should only be used for automated tasks from secure
machines (something that Kerberos is unsuited to do). We also recommend that you either
turn off key-forwarding in the ssh configuration, or that you make use of the <tt
class="LITERAL">from=IP/DOMAIN</tt> option that ssh allows in its <tt
class="FILENAME">authorized_keys</tt> file to make the key only usable to entities
logging in from specific machines.</p>

問題</a></h1>

<p>Turning on a computer and starting the operating system poses an interesting dilemma.
By definition, the computer does not know how to do anything until the operating system
is started. This includes running programs from the disk. So if the computer can not run
a program from the disk without the operating system, and the operating system programs
are on the disk, how is the operating system started?</p>

<p>This problem parallels one in the book <i class="CITETITLE">The Adventures of Baron
Munchausen</i>. A character had fallen part way down a manhole, and pulled himself out by
grabbing his bootstraps, and lifting. In the early days of computing the term <i
class="FIRSTTERM">bootstrap</i> was applied to the mechanism used to load the operating
system, which has become shortened to “booting”.</p>

<p>On x86 hardware the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) is responsible for loading the
operating system. To do this, the BIOS looks on the hard disk for the Master Boot Record
(MBR), which must be located on a specific place on the disk. The BIOS has enough
knowledge to load and run the MBR, and assumes that the MBR can then carry out the rest
of the tasks involved in loading the operating system, possibly with the help of the
BIOS.</p>

<p>The code within the MBR is usually referred to as a <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">boot manager</i></span>, especially when it interacts with the user. In
this case the boot manager usually has more code in the first <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">track</i></span> of the disk or within some OS's file system. (A boot
manager is sometimes also called a <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">boot
loader</i></span>, but FreeBSD uses that term for a later stage of booting.) Popular boot
managers include <b class="APPLICATION">boot0</b> (a.k.a. <b class="APPLICATION">Boot
Easy</b>, the standard FreeBSD boot manager), <b class="APPLICATION">Grub</b>, <b
class="APPLICATION">GAG</b>, and <b class="APPLICATION">LILO</b>. (Only <b
class="APPLICATION">boot0</b> fits within the MBR.)</p>

<p>If you have only one operating system installed on your disks then a standard PC MBR
will suffice. This MBR searches for the first bootable (a.k.a. active) slice on the disk,
and then runs the code on that slice to load the remainder of the operating system. The
MBR installed by <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fdisk&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">fdisk</span>(8)</span></a>, by default,
is such an MBR. It is based on <tt class="FILENAME">/boot/mbr</tt>.</p>

<p>If you have installed multiple operating systems on your disks then you can install a
different boot manager, one that can display a list of different operating systems, and
allows you to choose the one to boot from. Two of these are discussed in the next
subsection.</p>

<p>The remainder of the FreeBSD bootstrap system is divided into three stages. The first
stage is run by the MBR, which knows just enough to get the computer into a specific
state and run the second stage. The second stage can do a little bit more, before running
the third stage. The third stage finishes the task of loading the operating system. The
work is split into these three stages because the PC standards put limits on the size of
the programs that can be run at stages one and two. Chaining the tasks together allows
FreeBSD to provide a more flexible loader.</p>

<p>The kernel is then started and it begins to probe for devices and initialize them for
use. Once the kernel boot process is finished, the kernel passes control to the user
process <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=init&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">init</span>(8)</span></a>, which then
makes sure the disks are in a usable state. <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=init&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">init</span>(8)</span></a> then starts
the user-level resource configuration which mounts file systems, sets up network cards to
communicate on the network, and generally starts all the processes that usually are run
on a FreeBSD system at startup.</p>

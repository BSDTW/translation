<p>Among the many different file systems that FreeBSD supports is the Network File
System, also known as <acronym title="Network File System" class="ACRONYM">NFS</acronym>.
<acronym title="Network File System" class="ACRONYM">NFS</acronym> allows a system to
share directories and files with others over a network. By using <acronym
title="Network File System" class="ACRONYM">NFS</acronym>, users and programs can access
files on remote systems almost as if they were local files.</p>

<p>Some of the most notable benefits that <acronym class="ACRONYM">NFS</acronym> can
provide are:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Local workstations use less disk space because commonly used data can be stored on a
single machine and still remain accessible to others over the network.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>There is no need for users to have separate home directories on every network machine.
Home directories could be set up on the <acronym class="ACRONYM">NFS</acronym> server and
made available throughout the network.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Storage devices such as floppy disks, CDROM drives, and <span
class="TRADEMARK">Zip</span>&reg; drives can be used by other machines on the network.
This may reduce the number of removable media drives throughout the network.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN34591" name="AEN34591">25.3.1 How <acronym
class="ACRONYM">NFS</acronym> Works</a></h2>

<p><acronym class="ACRONYM">NFS</acronym> consists of at least two main parts: a server
and one or more clients. The client remotely accesses the data that is stored on the
server machine. In order for this to function properly a few processes have to be
configured and running.</p>

<div class="NOTE">
<blockquote class="NOTE">
<p><b>Note:</b> Under FreeBSD&nbsp;4.X, the <b class="APPLICATION">portmap</b> utility is

class="APPLICATION">rpcbind</b> with <b class="APPLICATION">portmap</b> in the
forthcoming examples.</p>

<p>The server has to be running the following daemons:</p>

not required for normal and correct operation. See the <a

<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="NETWORK-CONFIGURING-NFS" name="NETWORK-CONFIGURING-NFS">25.3.2
Configuring <acronym class="ACRONYM">NFS</acronym></a></h2>

<p><acronym class="ACRONYM">NFS</acronym> configuration is a relatively straightforward
process. The processes that need to be running can all start at boot time with a few
modifications to your <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/rc.conf</tt> file.</p>

<p>On the <acronym class="ACRONYM">NFS</acronym> server, make sure that the following
options are configured in the <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/rc.conf</tt> file:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
rpcbind_enable="YES"
nfs_server_enable="YES"
mountd_flags="-r"
</pre>

<p><b class="APPLICATION">mountd</b> runs automatically whenever the <acronym
class="ACRONYM">NFS</acronym> server is enabled.</p>

<p>On the client, make sure this option is present in <tt
class="FILENAME">/etc/rc.conf</tt>:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
nfs_client_enable="YES"
</pre>

<p>The <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/exports</tt> file specifies which file systems <acronym
class="ACRONYM">NFS</acronym> should export (sometimes referred to as “share”). Each
line in <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/exports</tt> specifies a file system to be exported and
which machines have access to that file system. Along with what machines have access to
that file system, access options may also be specified. There are many such options that
can be used in this file but only a few will be mentioned here. You can easily discover
other options by reading over the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=exports&amp;sektion=5"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">exports</span>(5)</span></a> manual
page.</p>

<p>Here are a few example <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/exports</tt> entries:</p>

<p>The following examples give an idea of how to export file systems, although the
settings may be different depending on your environment and network configuration. For
instance, to export the <tt class="FILENAME">/cdrom</tt> directory to three example
machines that have the same domain name as the server (hence the lack of a domain name
for each) or have entries in your <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/hosts</tt> file. The <code
class="OPTION">-ro</code> flag makes the exported file system read-only. With this flag,
the remote system will not be able to write any changes to the exported file system.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
/cdrom -ro host1 host2 host3
</pre>

<p>The following line exports <tt class="FILENAME">/home</tt> to three hosts by IP
address. This is a useful setup if you have a private network without a <acronym
class="ACRONYM">DNS</acronym> server configured. Optionally the <tt
class="FILENAME">/etc/hosts</tt> file could be configured for internal hostnames; please
review <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=hosts&amp;sektion=5"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">hosts</span>(5)</span></a> for more
information. The <code class="OPTION">-alldirs</code> flag allows the subdirectories to
be mount points. In other words, it will not mount the subdirectories but permit the
client to mount only the directories that are required or needed.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
/home  -alldirs  10.0.0.2 10.0.0.3 10.0.0.4
</pre>

<p>The following line exports <tt class="FILENAME">/a</tt> so that two clients from
different domains may access the file system. The <code
class="OPTION">-maproot=root</code> flag allows the <tt class="USERNAME">root</tt> user
on the remote system to write data on the exported file system as <tt
class="USERNAME">root</tt>. If the <tt class="LITERAL">-maproot=root</tt> flag is not
specified, then even if a user has <tt class="USERNAME">root</tt> access on the remote
system, he will not be able to modify files on the exported file system.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
/a  -maproot=root  host.example.com box.example.org
</pre>

<p>In order for a client to access an exported file system, the client must have
permission to do so. Make sure the client is listed in your <tt
class="FILENAME">/etc/exports</tt> file.</p>

<p>In <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/exports</tt>, each line represents the export information
for one file system to one host. A remote host can only be specified once per file
system, and may only have one default entry. For example, assume that <tt
class="FILENAME">/usr</tt> is a single file system. The following <tt
class="FILENAME">/etc/exports</tt> would be invalid:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
# Invalid when /usr is one file system
/usr/src   client
/usr/ports client
</pre>

<p>One file system, <tt class="FILENAME">/usr</tt>, has two lines specifying exports to
the same host, <tt class="HOSTID">client</tt>. The correct format for this situation
is:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
/usr/src /usr/ports  client
</pre>

<p>The properties of one file system exported to a given host must all occur on one line.
Lines without a client specified are treated as a single host. This limits how you can
export file systems, but for most people this is not an issue.</p>

<p>The following is an example of a valid export list, where <tt
class="FILENAME">/usr</tt> and <tt class="FILENAME">/exports</tt> are local file
systems:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
# Export src and ports to client01 and client02, but only
# client01 has root privileges on it
/usr/src /usr/ports -maproot=root    client01
/usr/src /usr/ports               client02
# The client machines have root and can mount anywhere
# on /exports. Anyone in the world can mount /exports/obj read-only
/exports -alldirs -maproot=root      client01 client02
/exports/obj -ro
</pre>

<p>You must restart <b class="APPLICATION">mountd</b> whenever you modify <tt
class="FILENAME">/etc/exports</tt> so the changes can take effect. This can be
accomplished by sending the HUP signal to the <tt class="COMMAND">mountd</tt>
process:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">#</samp> <kbd
class="USERINPUT">kill -HUP `cat /var/run/mountd.pid`</kbd>
</pre>

<p>Alternatively, a reboot will make FreeBSD set everything up properly. A reboot is not
necessary though. Executing the following commands as <tt class="USERNAME">root</tt>
should start everything up.</p>

<p>On the <acronym class="ACRONYM">NFS</acronym> server:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">#</samp> <kbd class="USERINPUT">rpcbind</kbd>
<samp class="PROMPT">#</samp> <kbd class="USERINPUT">nfsd -u -t -n 4</kbd>
<samp class="PROMPT">#</samp> <kbd class="USERINPUT">mountd -r</kbd>
</pre>

<p>On the <acronym class="ACRONYM">NFS</acronym> client:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">#</samp> <kbd class="USERINPUT">nfsiod -n 4</kbd>
</pre>

<p>Now everything should be ready to actually mount a remote file system. In these
examples the server's name will be <tt class="HOSTID">server</tt> and the client's name
will be <tt class="HOSTID">client</tt>. If you only want to temporarily mount a remote
file system or would rather test the configuration, just execute a command like this as
<tt class="USERNAME">root</tt> on the client:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">#</samp> <kbd class="USERINPUT">mount server:/home /mnt</kbd>
</pre>

<p>This will mount the <tt class="FILENAME">/home</tt> directory on the server at <tt
class="FILENAME">/mnt</tt> on the client. If everything is set up correctly you should be
able to enter <tt class="FILENAME">/mnt</tt> on the client and see all the files that are
on the server.</p>

<p>If you want to automatically mount a remote file system each time the computer boots,
add the file system to the <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/fstab</tt> file. Here is an
example:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
server:/home   /mnt    nfs rw  0   0
</pre>

<p>The <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fstab&amp;sektion=5"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">fstab</span>(5)</span></a> manual page

<p><acronym class="ACRONYM">NFS</acronym> has many practical uses. Some of the more
common ones are listed below:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Set several machines to share a CDROM or other media among them. This is cheaper and
often a more convenient method to install software on multiple machines.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>On large networks, it might be more convenient to configure a central <acronym
class="ACRONYM">NFS</acronym> server in which to store all the user home directories.
These home directories can then be exported to the network so that users would always
have the same home directory, regardless of which workstation they log in to.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Several machines could have a common <tt class="FILENAME">/usr/ports/distfiles</tt>
directory. That way, when you need to install a port on several machines, you can quickly
access the source without downloading it on each machine.</p>

<i class="AUTHORGROUP"><span class="CONTRIB">Contributed by</span> Wylie Stilwell.</i> <i
class="AUTHORGROUP"><span class="CONTRIB">Rewritten by</span> Chern Lee.</i> 

<p><a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=amd&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">amd</span>(8)</span></a> (the automatic
mounter daemon) automatically mounts a remote file system whenever a file or directory
within that file system is accessed. Filesystems that are inactive for a period of time
will also be automatically unmounted by <b class="APPLICATION">amd</b>. Using <b
class="APPLICATION">amd</b> provides a simple alternative to permanent mounts, as
permanent mounts are usually listed in <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/fstab</tt>.</p>

<p><b class="APPLICATION">amd</b> operates by attaching itself as an NFS server to the
<tt class="FILENAME">/host</tt> and <tt class="FILENAME">/net</tt> directories. When a
file is accessed within one of these directories, <b class="APPLICATION">amd</b> looks up
the corresponding remote mount and automatically mounts it. <tt
class="FILENAME">/net</tt> is used to mount an exported file system from an IP address,
while <tt class="FILENAME">/host</tt> is used to mount an export from a remote
hostname.</p>

<p>An access to a file within <tt class="FILENAME">/host/foobar/usr</tt> would tell <b
class="APPLICATION">amd</b> to attempt to mount the <tt class="FILENAME">/usr</tt> export
on the host <tt class="HOSTID">foobar</tt>.</p>

<div class="EXAMPLE"><a id="AEN34824" name="AEN34824"></a>
<p><b>Example 25-2. Mounting an Export with amd</b></p>

<p>You can view the available mounts of a remote host with the <tt
class="COMMAND">showmount</tt> command. For example, to view the mounts of a host named
<tt class="HOSTID">foobar</tt>, you can use:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">%</samp> <kbd class="USERINPUT">showmount -e foobar</kbd>
Exports list on foobar:
/usr                               10.10.10.0
/a                                 10.10.10.0
<samp class="PROMPT">%</samp> <kbd class="USERINPUT">cd /host/foobar/usr</kbd>
</pre>
</div>

<p>As seen in the example, the <tt class="COMMAND">showmount</tt> shows <tt
class="FILENAME">/usr</tt> as an export. When changing directories to <tt
class="FILENAME">/host/foobar/usr</tt>, <b class="APPLICATION">amd</b> attempts to
resolve the hostname <tt class="HOSTID">foobar</tt> and automatically mount the desired
export.</p>

<p><b class="APPLICATION">amd</b> can be started by the startup scripts by placing the
following lines in <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/rc.conf</tt>:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
amd_enable="YES"
</pre>

<p>Additionally, custom flags can be passed to <b class="APPLICATION">amd</b> from the
<code class="VARNAME">amd_flags</code> option. By default, <code
class="VARNAME">amd_flags</code> is set to:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
amd_flags="-a /.amd_mnt -l syslog /host /etc/amd.map /net /etc/amd.map"
</pre>

<p>The <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/amd.map</tt> file defines the default options that
exports are mounted with. The <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/amd.conf</tt> file defines some
of the more advanced features of <b class="APPLICATION">amd</b>.</p>

Problems Integrating with Other Systems</a></h2>

<i class="AUTHORGROUP"><span class="CONTRIB">Contributed by</span> John Lind.</i> 

<p>Certain Ethernet adapters for ISA PC systems have limitations which can lead to
serious network problems, particularly with NFS. This difficulty is not specific to
FreeBSD, but FreeBSD systems are affected by it.</p>

<p>The problem nearly always occurs when (FreeBSD) PC systems are networked with
high-performance workstations, such as those made by Silicon Graphics, Inc., and Sun
Microsystems, Inc. The NFS mount will work fine, and some operations may succeed, but
suddenly the server will seem to become unresponsive to the client, even though requests
to and from other systems continue to be processed. This happens to the client system,
whether the client is the FreeBSD system or the workstation. On many systems, there is no
way to shut down the client gracefully once this problem has manifested itself. The only
solution is often to reset the client, because the NFS situation cannot be resolved.</p>

<p>Though the “correct” solution is to get a higher performance and capacity Ethernet
adapter for the FreeBSD system, there is a simple workaround that will allow satisfactory
operation. If the FreeBSD system is the <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">server</i></span>, include the option <code
class="OPTION">-w=1024</code> on the mount from the client. If the FreeBSD system is the
<span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">client</i></span>, then mount the NFS file
system with the option <code class="OPTION">-r=1024</code>. These options may be
specified using the fourth field of the <tt class="FILENAME">fstab</tt> entry on the
client for automatic mounts, or by using the <code class="OPTION">-o</code> parameter of
the <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mount&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">mount</span>(8)</span></a> command for
manual mounts.</p>

<p>It should be noted that there is a different problem, sometimes mistaken for this one,
when the NFS servers and clients are on different networks. If that is the case, make
<span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">certain</i></span> that your routers are
routing the necessary <acronym class="ACRONYM">UDP</acronym> information, or you will not
get anywhere, no matter what else you are doing.</p>

<p>In the following examples, <tt class="HOSTID">fastws</tt> is the host (interface) name
of a high-performance workstation, and <tt class="HOSTID">freebox</tt> is the host
(interface) name of a FreeBSD system with a lower-performance Ethernet adapter. Also, <tt
class="FILENAME">/sharedfs</tt> will be the exported NFS file system (see <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=exports&amp;sektion=5"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">exports</span>(5)</span></a>), and <tt
class="FILENAME">/project</tt> will be the mount point on the client for the exported
file system. In all cases, note that additional options, such as <code
class="OPTION">hard</code> or <code class="OPTION">soft</code> and <code
class="OPTION">bg</code> may be desirable in your application.</p>

<p>Examples for the FreeBSD system (<tt class="HOSTID">freebox</tt>) as the client in <tt
class="FILENAME">/etc/fstab</tt> on <tt class="HOSTID">freebox</tt>:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
fastws:/sharedfs /project nfs rw,-r=1024 0 0
</pre>

<p>As a manual mount command on <tt class="HOSTID">freebox</tt>:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">#</samp> <kbd
class="USERINPUT">mount -t nfs -o -r=1024 fastws:/sharedfs /project</kbd>
</pre>

<p>Examples for the FreeBSD system as the server in <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/fstab</tt>
on <tt class="HOSTID">fastws</tt>:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
freebox:/sharedfs /project nfs rw,-w=1024 0 0
</pre>

<p>As a manual mount command on <tt class="HOSTID">fastws</tt>:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">#</samp> <kbd
class="USERINPUT">mount -t nfs -o -w=1024 freebox:/sharedfs /project</kbd>
</pre>

<p>Nearly any 16-bit Ethernet adapter will allow operation without the above restrictions
on the read or write size.</p>

<p>For anyone who cares, here is what happens when the failure occurs, which also
explains why it is unrecoverable. NFS typically works with a “block” size of 8&nbsp;K
(though it may do fragments of smaller sizes). Since the maximum Ethernet packet is
around 1500&nbsp;bytes, the NFS “block” gets split into multiple Ethernet packets, even
though it is still a single unit to the upper-level code, and must be received,
assembled, and <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">acknowledged</i></span> as a
unit. The high-performance workstations can pump out the packets which comprise the NFS
unit one right after the other, just as close together as the standard allows. On the
smaller, lower capacity cards, the later packets overrun the earlier packets of the same
unit before they can be transferred to the host and the unit as a whole cannot be
reconstructed or acknowledged. As a result, the workstation will time out and try again,
but it will try again with the entire 8&nbsp;K unit, and the process will be repeated, ad
infinitum.</p>

<p>By keeping the unit size below the Ethernet packet size limitation, we ensure that any
complete Ethernet packet received can be acknowledged individually, avoiding the deadlock
situation.</p>

<p>Overruns may still occur when a high-performance workstations is slamming data out to
a PC system, but with the better cards, such overruns are not guaranteed on NFS
“units”. When an overrun occurs, the units affected will be retransmitted, and there
will be a fair chance that they will be received, assembled, and acknowledged.</p>
